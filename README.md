Hey, I’m Squidonomics and this blog is a place for me to code/write about my crack theories and ideas from random math journals. I’ve been professionally coding for the past two years and I’m finally merging my interest in mathematics and computer science with finance. I don’t think any of these will have a significant impact on anything but my knowledge of hyper specific segments of mathematics. 

My research methods are, all around, pretty casual. This is for fun after all, I just look for publications that interest me and see how I could turn them into a functioning financial model in a month. I’ll probably use C++ to start but I would also love to try some new languages as well alongside it. 

I’ll be posting weekly updates on Wednesday. Fortunately for me I picked the perfect month to start since Wednesday is also the first of the month. Expect a post about the topic and so early analysis in the coming week. I’ll try to save releasing the full repo for the end of the month in the final blog post for that project. I’d like to make them fully fleshed out so anyone can clone the repo then run it on some finance modeler or sim market. I’m looking forward to making progress in my math knowledge and programming skill! Enjoy reading!
